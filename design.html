                <p>
                    This pages shows you some UI design that I created on a social platform called Cocoda. <br>
                    I mainly designed daily subjects that it provided. <br>
                    These are made on XD.<br>
                    There're more works of mine on "my design on Cocoda" so make sure to check it out.<br>
                    
                    <div class="cocoda_button">

            <div class=design>
                <div class=app>
                    <h2>App</h2>
                    <div class=bookbar>
                        <img src="img/bookbar.png">
                        <p>Subject: Screen of bar graph on reading app<br>
                            Target: Men in their twenties who tend to pile unread books but want to enjoy reading<br>
                            The point of this design is the colour that looks like library. <br>
                            By using colours that make people remind of historical libraries, they can feel like they're in a library wherever they are and it makes them read more books.<br>
                            On the top, you can choose from "Day, week, month, year" and bar graph will change. <br>
                            The current screen tells you time sideways and pages lengthwise. <br>
                            Then, on the bottom, graphs are placed to compare today with yesterday so that they can be motivated.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class=calender>
                        <p>Subject: Screen of calender<br>
                            Target: women in thier twenties who aim to be independent<br>
                            The points of this design is that they can write a message to themselves or goals in the month on the top. <br>
                            People open this app every day because they usually check their schedules for the day, so through memorization to see the message, they can act actually and improve themselves.<br>
                            So, I placed space for detailed schedules including time and content. <br>
                            It appear a circle on more important schedules on the list to manage your days efficiently.<br>
                            Improvement is the colour. <br>
                            I used too childish bright pink, but light pink or orange would be better for mature women.
                        </p>

                        <p>Subject: Search screen of map app<br>
                            Target: Junior high school students who just get their first smart phone<br>
                            As a good point, I put space to write necessary information on a place everyone can reach. <br>
                            Especially, space of date and departure are easy to use when they're in a hurry.<br>
                            Also, the design is simple, so they can use whenever, whoever and when growing up.

                        <p>These are icons of YouTube, E-mail and Instagram made by myself on XD. <br>
                            The colour is rose gold that is the same as this website and light rose gold not to be part of the white background. <br>
                            The most confusing part was organizing space of each square.<br>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class=weathericon>
                        <p>This is a subject of design on Cocoda "icon of weather app".<br>
                            I chose rainbow as a background colour not to discriminate against weather neither sunny nor rainy.<br>
                            Then, the shape of the middle is cloud that excites you because it can change to sunny or rainy.

                        <p>I made them on XD for my YouTube. <br>
                            It's almost the same as icons I showed you above, but I designed it to recognize it as instagram and YouTube at once.
                        </p>

                    <div class=triangle>
                        <img src="img/triangle.jpg">
                        <p>Name cards I'll show you are a subject I found at first.<br>
                            I'm planning to sell design like them in the future.<br>
                            These design have white, gray and rose gold triangles at the top and at the bottom, black is added. <br>
                            They look stylish and mature, so you can use in various situations.<br>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class=marble>
                        <p>The background of this name card is rose gold and white marble that I made on Illustrator. <br>
                            The marble is subtle, so you can use this in any situation as well. <br>
                            Also, the transparent white background is very lovely.
